JARVIS â€“ Assistant for the Future

Step 1: Set up the environment
Before installing any packages or modules, make sure you have a working Python environment set up on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you have installed Python, you can open a command prompt or terminal window to proceed with the next steps.

Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
Navigate to the directory where your project is located. You can use the cd command in your command prompt or terminal to change the directory. For example, if your project is located in a folder called myproject, you can navigate to it using the following command:
cd myproject

Step 3: Install required modules
In the myproject directory, you should have a file called requirements.txt that lists the required modules for your project. To install these modules, you can use the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the required modules listed in the requirements.txt file.

Step 4: Compile the Python file
Assuming the Javis.py file is located in the myproject directory, you can compile it using the following command:
python Javis.py

This will run the Python script and execute the code.
